  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:

    - Assets/Photos/
    - Assets/Icons/FoodIcon/
    - Assets/Icons/PaymentMode/
    - Assets/Animation/

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
